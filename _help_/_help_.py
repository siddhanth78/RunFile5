RunFile v5.2.2.
RunFile helps simplify file manipulation. Optimised for python files.
RunFile is used mainly for file manipulation. It is optimised for python files as RunFile can
explore deep into your code, access the code's functions and classes, run functions seperately,
search for desired function or class in the code and run the code itself.
Command and arguments are seperated by '::'.
Use command 'help' and enter a command name for its info.
